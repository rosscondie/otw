# OverTheWire Bandit 

### Level 0 -> Level 1
- password needed: ZjLjTmM6FvvyRnrb2rfNWOZOTa6ip5If

### Level 1 -> Level 2
- password needed: 263JGJPfgU6LtdEvgfWU1XP5yac29mFx
  - this was also done using a `-` as a filename so you can cat this with `./-` to see the contents. also using vim to open the file worked.

### Level 2 -> Level 3
- password needed: MNk8KNH3Usiio41PRUEoDFPqfxLPlSmx
  - this was about escaping spaces in filenames like --space in the filename-- and how to use quotes or just use tab to autocomplete.

### Level 3 -> Level 4
- password needed: 2WmrDFRmJIq3IPxneAaMGhap0pFhF3NJ
  - this was looking for the password that was stored in a hidden file
  - using ls with the flag `-alps` allows us to:
    - `-a` show all files, including hidden ones (those starting with `.`)
    - `-l` use long listing format (permissions, owner, size, date etc...)
    - `p` append a `/` to directory names so they are easy to spot
    - `s` show file sizes in blocks (1 block = 512 bytes but can vary)

### Level 4 -> 5
- password needed: 4oQYVPkxZOOEOO5pTW81FB8j8lxXGUQw
  - I went through everyfile by using vim and checking which one was human readable but I saw a solution which used `find . -type f | xargs file`

### Level 5 -> 6
- password needed: HWasnPhtq9AVKe0dmk45nxy20cvUa6EG
  - The file we were looking for was to be 1033 bytes, not executable and human readable. Using the find command we could `find . -type f ! -executable -size 1033c` which gave us ./maybehere007/.file2 which we then used cat to see the password.

### Level 6 -> 7
- password needed: morbNTDkSW6jIlUc0ymOdMaLnOlFVAaj
  - The file to find was found by using `find / -type f -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c` which gave us a lot of files with the message Permission denied. 
  - The `find /` searches "somewhere on the server" the `/` meaning the parent directory or root. 
  - We can then use `2>/dev/null` to redirect the all the errors and such which will show us our password file.
  
### Level 7 -> 8
- password needed: dfwvzFQi4mU0wfNbFOe9RoWskMLg7eEc
  - The password was stored in data.txt file next to the word "millionth" where we ran `grep "millionth" data.txt` to search for it. 
  - Another way would be to redirect or pipe the output from `cat data.txt | grep "millionth` which would output our password.

### Level 8 -> 9 
- password needed: 4CKMh1JI91bUIZZPXDqGanal4xvAg0JM
  - The password was stored in a data.txt and is the only line of text that occurs only once. 
  - This was found using the `sort` and `uniq` commands by `sort data.txt | uniq -u`which sorted the data.txt file and found the only occurence of the string.

### Level 9 -> 10
- password needed: FGUW5ilLVJrxX9kMYMmlN4MgbpfMiqey
  - `strings` is a command we can use to find the human readable strings from a binary file. We know that the string is preceded by several "=" characters so:
  `strings data.txt | grep =` gives us the strings preceded by the "=" characters.

### Level 10 -> 11
- password needed: dtR173fZKb0RRsDFSGsg2RWnpNVj3qRr
  - The password was stored in a data.txt file that contained base64 encoded data.
  - We used `base64 -d` to decode the data.txt file `base 64 -d data.txt` to give us the output of the password.

### Level 11 -> 12
- password needed: 7x16WNeHIi5YkIhWsfFIqoognUTyj9Q4 
  - The password was stored in data.txt file where all lowercase (a-z) and uppercase (A-Z) letters were rotated by 13 positions (ROT 13).
  - `cat data.txt | tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m` worked to rotate them and show us the password

### Level 12 -> 13
- password needed: FO5dwFsc0cbaIiH0h8J2eUks2vdTDwAn
  - Using `xxd` allows us to make a hexdump or using the flag `-r` do a reverse hexdump. Performing a reverse of the hexdump and get the output of that particular file. 
  - `xxd -r data.txt > data` output the information into another file. 
  - using `file data` this allows us to see the file type of data which shows us it was gzip compressed data. 
  - We need to change the file extension before decompressing with `mv data data.gz`
  - Then we can run `gzip -d data.gz` (-d decompress) and check the files available with `ls`
  - With `file $(filename)` we can then check again the type and repeat the process until we have decompressed the file. It takes a while as it was compressed a lot.
  - We also seen the `.tar` file extension which we can use `tar xf $(filename).tar
  - Ultimately every time we want to decompress the file with a utility we must rename the file to be compatible e.g. `.tar/.bz2/.gz`

### Level 13 -> 14
- password needed: MU4VWeTyJk8ROof1qqmcBPaLh7lDCPvS
  - There was a couple of interesting ways to do this. The ssh key was found in the home directory of bandit13@bandit called `sshkey.private` which you could then use to ssh into the bandit14@localhost server. `ssh -i sshkey.private bandit14@localhost -p 2220` which would log us in as bandit14. 
  - Then we could just cat the contents of `/etc/bandit_pass/bandit14` to get the password. 
  - Then I found a blog post saying to use `scp -P 2220 bandit13@bandit.labs.overthewire.org:sshkey.private . ` which allows us to connect to the remote machine and get the key on our machine locally. Now after the host `bandit.labs.overthewire.org` the file path is then expected. 
  - We can use `:sshkey.private .` as its in the home directory and specify `.` to save it to our current directory. 

### Level 14 -> 15
- password needed: 8xCjnmgoKbGLhHFAZlGE5Tmu4M2tKJQo
  - The password for this level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to port 30000 on localhost.
  - I done this by looking at the telnet utility `man telnet`
  - `telnet localhost 30000` then pasting in the password needed from previous level.
  - It could also be achieved by using `nc` or `netcat` in a similar fashion:
    - `nc localhost 30000`

### Level 15 -> 16
- password needed: kSkvUpMQ7lBYyCM4GBPvCvT1BfWRy0Dx
  - The password for this level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to port 30001 on localhost using SSL/TLS encryption.
  - Using `openssl` I was able to do this but I had a few problems with the commands and had to read the manual for openssl then use the `--help` flag to see how to use it. `openssl s_client --help` showed:
    - `Usage: s_client [options] [host:port]` which was different to before with telnet.
    - `openssl s_client localhost:30001` connected me localhost on port 30001 and I was able to submit the password from the previous level to get the next one.
    - Now the official syntax I learned after was to use the `-connect` flag as some builds allow us to give the host:port directly so we should always use:
      - `openssl s_client -connect [host:port]`

### Level 16 -> 17
- **Password needed:** I stored this in an `sshkey17.private` file.
  - **Don't forget:** The file needs the correct permissions: `chmod 600` - read/write only for the owner. Some people said 700 but I read thats only for the directory `~/.ssh`.
  - The way we achieved this was to first find out which ports have a server listening on them using `nmap`. The challenge asked to look for a port on localhost in the range `31000-32000`, so we could do that with:  
    ```bash
    nmap -p 31000-32000 localhost
    ```
  - You could also use the `-sV` option for service discovery, which takes a bit longer but lets you know which ports are running SSL/TLS.
  - Then, using `openssl`, we can connect to the desired port with:  
    ```bash
    openssl s_client -connect localhost:31790
    ```
    (In this instance, `31790/tcp open ssl/unknown` was the port we were looking for.)
  - `OpenSSL s_client` defaults to interactive mode, meaning that every key pressed is interpreted rather than waiting for you to press enter.
  - The keys `k`, `K`, `Q`, and `R` have specific purposes outlined in the manpage for `openssl s_client` under the **CONNECTED COMMANDS** section:
    - `Q` ends the session
    - `R` renegotiates the session
    - `k` sends a key update
    - `k` sends a key update and requests one back
  - Since `s_client` is interactive, if the password happens to start with one of these characters, it will interpret it as a command instead of as part of the data youâ€™re trying to send.
  - The `-quiet` flag prevents this behavior and lets you send your data uninhibited.

### Level 17 -> 18
- **Password needed:** x2gLTTjFwMOhQ8oWNbMN362QKxfRqGlO
  - This was to done using the `diff` command to compare two files to see the only line that had been changed between them. If you are familiar with git running `diff $(filename) $(filename2)` would suffice.
  - You can also format it differently using the `-c` flag or make it more complex (or verbose, people seem to love using this word) by adding `diff --side-by-side --suppress-common-lines $(filename) $(filename2)` for a different output.

### Level 18 -> 19
- **Password needed:** cGWpMaKXVwDUNgPAVJbWYuGHVn9zl3j8
  - I approached this slightly differently by using the `scp` command and then to copy the file (readme) where the password was stored. 
  - `scp -P 2220 bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org:readme .` then used cat to view the contents or vim/nvim.
  - I then read that you can can remotely execute commands through ssh as well which is pretty cool to learn.
  - `ssh bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 ls` to make sure the readme is where we were told it was. 
  - Then use `ssh bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 cat readme`

### Level 19 -> 20 
- **Password needed:** 0qXahG8ZjOVMN9Ghs7iOWsCfZyXOUbYO
  - This is one that I am going to have to read a little bit more about regarding permissions and how it works. The website explains to use setuid to understand what is going on but it was a bit more difficult to wrap my head around.
  - After running `ls -la` it gave me a break down of the permissions | user | group | filesize | date/time | file or directory name.
  - The file `bandit20-do` permissions were `-rwsr-x---` which effectively means the executable permission is replaced with a special permission Suid. 
  - The binary will be run as the owner of the binary not the one executing it. 
  - Our file was owned by bandit20 and the group is bandit19.
  - So since we are currently user bandit19 trying to run `cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit20` to get the password will give us a Permission denied.
  - If we execute our binary it will allow us to run a command as bandit20.
  - `./bandit20-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit20` is what we want.

### Level 20 -> 21
- **Password needed:** EeoULMCra2q0dSkYj561DX7s1CpBuOBt
  - This is another one that I seen was done in a few different ways so I am trying to wrap my head around how it was done. 
  - We need to setup a listener on any port on the system you specify as a commandline argument. We can setup a listener with the `netcat` command. 
  - If we echo the previous password we obtained to log into level bandit20 as `echo "0qXahG8ZjOVMN9Ghs7iOWsCfZyXOUbYO"` this will display the password as standard output in the terminal. We want to pipe this over to the netcat command.
  - `echo "0qXahG8ZjOVMN9Ghs7iOWsCfZyXOUbYO" | netcat -lp 1234` the -l flag is used to setup the listener and the -p flag is used to specify the port the listener should be on. If we do not specify an IP Address the listener will run on localhost. 
  - There were a few solutions done using two terminals or terminal panes to run the listener and then connect using the other but if we use `&` at the end of the command this will specify to run the command in the background. 
  - The `jobs` command can be used to view all the processes/jobs on the system. 
  - We can use the ./suconnect 1234 (our port number) to connect with the binary file on the same port and as soon as we connect the password of the previous level is compared with the text we specified and if they match we get a password for the next level.

### Level 21 -> 22
- **Password needed:** tRae0UfB9v0UzbCdn9cY0gQnds9GF58Q
  - A program is running automatically at regular intervals from cron, the time-based job scheduler. Look in /etc/cron.d/ for the configuration and see what command is being executed.
  - After going to look inside the directory and see what files were there, one was called `cronjob_bandit22` which seemed to spark curiosity. 
  - After using cat to determine the contents we can see the following:
  ```bash
  @reboot bandit22 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh &> /dev/null
  * * * * * bandit22 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh &> /dev/null
  ```
  - This shows us that a cronjob is running the `cronjob_bandit22.sh` file as bandit22 user. The five stars indicate it is run every minute, every day. 
  - We need to have a look at the file to see what the script is doing. 
  ```bash
  bandit21@bandit:/etc/cron.d$ cat /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh
  #!/bin/bash
  chmod 644 /tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv
  cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit22 > /tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv
  ```
  - We can see that it creates a file in the 'tmp' directory and copies the input of the bandit22 password file into the newly created file.
    - It's probably worth reading and researching a bit more on permissions to find out more about them.
    - 644 means you can read and write the file or directory and other users can only read it.
    - The numbers relate to octal values for user, group and other. 
    - I found a cheatsheet [here](https://elhacker.info/Cursos/Complete%20Linux%20Training%20Course%20to%20Get%20Your%20Dream%20IT%20Job%202023/4%20-%20Module%204%20Linux%20Fundamentals/83%20-%2011-File-Permissions-Cheat-Sheet.pdf) explaining the permissions. 
  - So if we cat the contents of the 'tmp' file we should get our next password.
    - ```bash
      bandit21@bandit:/etc/cron.d$ cat /tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv
      tRae0UfB9v0UzbCdn9cY0gQnds9GF58Q
      ```
### Level 22 -> 23
- **Password needed:** 0Zf11ioIjMVN551jX3CmStKLYqjk54Ga

  - We need to look inside the `/etc/cron.d` directory again and cat out the contents of the file we need. In this case the `cronjob_bandit23` file.

  - ```bash
    bandit22@bandit:/etc/cron.d$ cat cronjob_bandit23
    @reboot bandit23 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit23.sh  &> /dev/null
    * * * * * bandit23 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit23.sh  &> /dev/null
    ```

  - Then we can cat the contents of the script to see what it does.

  ```bash
  bandit22@bandit:/etc/cron.d$ cat /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit23.sh
  #!/bin/bash

  myname=$(whoami)
  mytarget=$(echo I am user $myname | md5sum | cut -d ' ' -f 1)

  echo "Copying passwordfile /etc/bandit_pass/$myname to /tmp/$mytarget"

  cat /etc/bandit_pass/$myname > /tmp/$mytarget
  ```

  - I wasn't really sure what this did not being familiar with bash scripting so I ran the script to investigate.

    ```bash
    bandit22@bandit:/etc/cron.d$ /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit23.sh
    Copying passwordfile /etc/bandit_pass/bandit22 to /tmp/8169b67bd894ddbb4412f91573b38db3
    ```

  - Basically the `whomai` command will print the current user when the command is invoked. Since we are logged in as bandit22 the variable 'myname' will use that value. 

  - We want to copy the password file for the bandit23 user.

  - There is a few ways to do this as always...

    - You could change the variable with `myname=bandit23` then to get the 'mytarget' variable `echo I am user $myname | md5sum | cut -d ' ' -f 1`. 

    - Or `echo I am user bandit23 | md5sum | cut -d ' ' -f 1` which will print the
    'mytarget' variable which we can use to cat the next level password:

    ```bash
    bandit22@bandit:/etc/cron.d$ echo I am user $myname | md5sum | cut -d ' ' -f 1
    8ca319486bfbbc3663ea0fbe81326349
    bandit22@bandit:/etc/cron.d$ cat /tmp/8ca319486bfbbc3663ea0fbe81326349
    0Zf11ioIjMVN551jX3CmStKLYqjk54Ga
    ```

### Level 23 -> 24
- **Password needed:**
